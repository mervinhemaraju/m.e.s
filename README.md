### **Note:** This is an outdated repo. This app has been migrated to Flutter for cross platform deployment. The new flutter repo can be found [here](https://github.com/mervinhemaraju/mauritius-emergency-services). Feel free to look into the previous code to have an idea on how MES started using Android's native Jetpack Compose.
